    Test that create_cover_letter_chain properly creates the chain structure and logic
    without making actual API calls to OpenAI.

    This test validates the chain's structure and logic without expensive API calls:
    1. The LLM is properly instantiated with correct configuration
    2. The function returns a valid Runnable chain object
    3. The chain structure is correctly built with mocked LLM components
    4. No actual network calls are made to the OpenAI API
