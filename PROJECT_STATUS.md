# HuskyApply Project Status

## âœ… Addressed Issues & Improvements

### Build Artifacts Management
- **âœ… .pyc and .class files**: Comprehensive .gitignore coverage for Python/Java compilation artifacts
- **âœ… __pycache__ directories**: Excluded from version control
- **âœ… Build outputs**: No tracked build artifacts (verified: 0 files)

### File Organization  
- **âœ… Frontend experiments cleanup**: `frontend/experiments/` completely removed
- **âœ… Makefile.original removal**: Duplicate configuration file eliminated
- **âœ… Unnecessary files**: No unused tox.ini or redundant config files

### Repository Structure
```
brain/              # Python AI service (clean)
gateway/            # Java Spring Boot API (clean) 
frontend/           # Vanilla JS UI (clean, no experiments)
ops/               # Operations isolated
  â”œâ”€â”€ infra/       # Docker configurations
  â”œâ”€â”€ k8s/         # Kubernetes manifests
  â””â”€â”€ scripts/     # Deployment scripts
docs/              # Core documentation only
  â””â”€â”€ appendix/    # Detailed guides separated
scripts/           # Development utilities
Makefile           # Simple, professional commands
```

### Quality Assurance
- **âœ… Pre-push hooks**: Automatic validation for build artifacts, secrets, large files
- **âœ… Comprehensive .gitignore**: Python, Java, Frontend artifacts all covered
- **âœ… Clean workspace script**: One-command cleanup for all build outputs
- **âœ… Security validation**: Frontend configs use environment variables only

### Developer Experience
- **âœ… One-command setup**: `make setup` - installs all dependencies
- **âœ… Simple operations**: `make run`, `make test`, `make clean`
- **âœ… Clear documentation**: Architecture and setup guides
- **âœ… Professional presentation**: HR-friendly README with clear ownership
