## About This Learning Journey

This project represents months of learning and experimentation with technologies I wanted to understand better. As a software engineer, I'm passionate about distributed systems and AI, so I decided to build something that would let me explore both areas hands-on.

### 🎯 What I Wanted to Learn
- How to design microservices that actually scale (not just in theory)
- Practical AI integration beyond simple API calls
- Kubernetes deployment and monitoring in a real system
- Building something complex enough to put on my resume

### 💻 Technologies I Practiced With
- **Backend Architecture** - Java Spring Boot for the gateway, Python FastAPI for AI processing
- **Infrastructure** - Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration, Redis caching
- **AI/ML** - LangChain framework, multiple AI providers, prompt engineering
- **Monitoring** - Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, proper logging

The code isn't perfect - there are definitely some areas I'd refactor if I were starting over, and I went through several iterations before landing on the current architecture. But that's part of the learning process!
